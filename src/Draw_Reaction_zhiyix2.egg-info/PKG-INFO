  ```
This program draws reactions from given txt file.
The given txt file has to include the reaction section according to the format below:
// Reactions:
  ```sh
  J0: MKKK => MKKK_P; uVol*J0_V1*MKKK/((1 + (MAPK_PP/J0_Ki)^J0_n)*(J0_K1 + MKKK));

  J1: MKKK_P => MKKK; uVol*J1_V2*MKKK_P/(J1_KK2 + MKKK_P);

  J2: MKK => MKK_P; uVol*J2_k3*MKKK_P*MKK/(J2_KK3 + MKK);

  J3: MKK_P => MKK_PP; uVol*J3_k4*MKKK_P*MKK_P/(J3_KK4 + MKK_P);

  J4: MKK_PP => MKK_P; uVol*J4_V5*MKK_PP/(J4_KK5 + MKK_PP);

  J5: MKK_P => MKK; uVol*J5_V6*MKK_P/(J5_KK6 + MKK_P);
  ```
